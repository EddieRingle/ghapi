A Java wrapper for v2 of the GitHub API.

To setup GHAPI, import the GitHubAPI class and do the following:

1. Create a GitHubAPI object:
	GitHubAPI gapi = new GitHubAPI();
2. That's it!

Authenticating in GHAPI:

	When you first create the GitHubAPI object, all requests will be made
	anonymously. To authenticate:
		gapi.authenticate("myusername", "mypassword");

Using GHAPI:

	Accessing the API through GHAPI is done through objects instantiated
	by the GitHubAPI class, each containing their own API calls. You can
	access each by doing the following:
		// Repository
		gapi.repo.<...>
		// User
		gapi.user.<...>
		// Issues
		gapi.issues.<...>
		// Commits
		gapi.commits.<...>
		// Object
		gapi.object.<...>
